  - Informational: System changes and notable events (large profit opportunities, market shifts)

### **Security Measures**
- Multi-signature requirements for capital movements above thresholds.
- Cold/hot wallet separation with tiered access controls.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Encrypted communications and secure key management.

## **Regulatory & Compliance Considerations**

- **Capital Efficiency vs. Risk**: Flash loans increase efficiency but introduce additional points of failure.
- **Specialization vs. Breadth**: Focusing on Solana provides optimization advantages but limits opportunity space.
- **Automation vs. Oversight**: Fully automated systems maximize speed but may miss nuanced market conditions.

By implementing this layered architecture with continuous optimization feedback loops, the arbitrage system can adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining profitability and risk controls.
